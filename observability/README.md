# OrbXGen Observability Platform

This project provides a comprehensive observability solution for modern cloud-native applications, with a focus on Kubernetes and microservices architectures. It leverages a suite of powerful open-source tools to deliver insights into system performance, health, and behavior.

## Core Components

The observability platform is built around the following key components:

- **Prometheus:** A time-series database and monitoring system for collecting and storing metrics.
- **Grafana:** A visualization and analytics platform for creating dashboards and exploring data.
- **OpenTelemetry:** A collection of APIs, SDKs, and tools for instrumenting applications and collecting telemetry data (metrics, traces, and logs).
- **Loki:** A log aggregation system designed to store and query logs from all your applications and infrastructure.
- **Tempo:** A high-scale, minimal-dependency distributed tracing backend.

## Getting Started

This project is designed to be deployed on Kubernetes, but can also be run locally using Docker Compose for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- kubectl
- A running Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, Kind, or a cloud provider's managed Kubernetes service)

### Deployment

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/orbxgen-observability.git
   cd orbxgen-observability
   ```

2. **Deploy the observability stack:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/manifests/
   ```

3. **Access the dashboards:**

   - **Grafana:** `http://localhost:3000`
   - **Prometheus:** `http://localhost:9090`

## Directory Structure
